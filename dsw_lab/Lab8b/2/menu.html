                    <p>A cheeseburger is a hamburger topped with cheese. Traditionally, the slice of cheese is placed on
                        top of the meat patty. The cheese is usually added to the cooking hamburger patty shortly before
                        serving, which allows the cheese to melt. Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure,
                        ingredients and composition. </p>

                    <p>Pizza is an Italian dish consisting of a usually
                        round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
                        various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),
                        which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza
                        is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo. </p>

                    <p>Paneer Butter Masala recipe is a rich and creamy dish of paneer (cottage cheese) in a tomato,

                    <p>Naan is a leavened bread made using all purpose flour. It is extremely popular in the Indian
                        subcontinent.

                        It is made with basic ingredients like flour, oil, yeast, milk. One can also make naan without
                        yeast but I prefer the version with yeast.
                        You can either cook the naan in a tandoor (clay oven, often used by Indian restaurants) or bake
                        them in the oven.
                        My choice for cooking naan is the stove-top. I bake them as well but prefer cooking them on a
                        cast iron skillet.</p>

                    <p>FLassi (pronounced [ləsːi]) is a popular traditional dahi (yogurt)-based drink that originated in
                        the Punjab region.[1][2][3] Lassi is a blend of yogurt, water, spices and sometimes fruit.
                        Namkeen (salty) lassi is similar to doogh, while sweet and mango lassis are like milkshakes.
                        Lassi may be infused with cannabis in the form of bhang. Chaas is a similar drink of a thinner
                        consistency. </p>
